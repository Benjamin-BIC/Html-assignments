        <legend><strong>Why did you join Tinyuka 2024?</strong></legend>
        <p>
          I joined Tinyuka 2024 because I want to acquire in-demand skills
          especially with regards to tech because it facinates me a lot. When I
          look at the wonders Engineers especially software engineers at
          <a href="https://www.tesla.com/">Tesla</a>, one of the biggest
          technological compaines in the world, are doing with their in-house
          softwares developed from the scratch,
          <abbr title="Over The Air">OTA</abbr> updates and how their efforts
          are improving their products even outside the factory, you will easily
          know that they are the future.<br />
          Some other great compaines that are doing a lot of work that will make
          life easier tomorrow includes SpaceX, Starlink, Nvidia, Apple,
          AltSchholAfrica etc. The effort of the engineers in these compaines
          enabled me to understand that a lot can be made possible with well
          written software program. Tesla is coming up fast with their FSD
          technology and Optimus robot which is crazy together with their speed
          of iteration... This decade and next will be filled with a lot of
          engineering marvel which I will like to be part of.
